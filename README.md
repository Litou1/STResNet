# STResNet
Spatial-Temporal ResNet code for efficient CT image denoising.
This repository is the official implementation of [Efficient and Accurate Spatial-Temporal Denoising Network for LDCT scans](url)


## Requirements
* CUDA > 10.2, cuDNN > 7.6
* Python virualenv
  To install requirements:
  ```setup
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Pull docker container 
  ```
  docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:19.11-py3
  ```
<!-- > ðŸ“‹Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc... -->


<!-- > ðŸ“‹Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters. -->

## Evaluation
To evaluate the model in test set, run:
```eval
python test.py -opt options/test/<config_name>.json
```
Note that our UCLA data are in h5, set `data_type` to `h5` in json.  
To evaluate with your own dicom images, chage `data_type` to `dicom` in json. You need to prepare your own input folder with each case folder containing all .dcm images. The resulting outputs are saved at result folder.

## Models
Pretrained models are stored in experiemnts\<run_name>\models\xxx.pth folder

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on image metrics and speed-ups.
